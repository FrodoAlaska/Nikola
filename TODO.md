# Road To A Game 
- [x] Filesystem
- [x] GUI v0.1
- [x] Renderer v0.1
    - [x] Create a 2D batch renderer that can handle basic shapes and textures.
    - [x] A way to have default renderer resources (like the matrices buffer and a white texture).
    - [x] Support for diffuse and specular maps.
    - [x] Some of the textures on models get loaded weirdly
    - [x] Need to find a better way to send default uniforms with materials.
- [x] Resource Manager v0.3
    - [x] A better way to refer to the resources
    - [x] Find a way to list all of the required resources for an application
    - [x] Resource groups
    - [x] File watcher system using C++'s std::filesystem
    - [x] Completely remove any pointer to resources. Just refer to resoruces with their IDs
    - [x] Implement `nbr_import` functions that will convert NBR resource formats into engine resource formats.

    - [x] Documentation
- [x] NBR v0.2 
    - [x] Have the `nbrlist` file be a list of all the resoruces required by a game. The tool will read said NBRList file and convert all of them to the `.nbr*` format.
    - [x] Be able to rename an output file 
    - [x] Have the ability to go through a directory and convert cubemaps 
    - [x] If the `--resource-type` flag is omitted, let the tool "guess" which resource is being converted. Perhaps get rid of the glag all together? 
    - [x] Implement a job system or, rather, multi-threading for the tool to make conversions faster, especially for resources like 3D models.
    - [x] Improve the README
- [x] Build System Improvement v0.2 
    - [x] Improve the CMake situation

    - [x] A more pipelined post-processing system.
- [x] Resource Rendering v0.1
    - [x] Create a `ShaderContext` structure to encapsulate shader functionality.
    - [x] Seperate the shader and the materials from each other. The materials should only be a description of the physical properties of any renderable type. 
    - [x] Add the `ShaderContext` as a new resource type.
    - [x] Incorporate `ShaderContext` into rendering
    - [x] Improve the rendering of 3D models (perhaps each mesh is a specific render command?)

    - [x] Documentation
- [x] Annoying Bugs To Fix 
    - [x] The wonderful and useful `resoruces_push_dir` function doesn't work and seg faults for some reason. Please fix.
    - [x] Actually, the whole filewatcher system might be _extremely_ slow. At least that's what I saw in the data. Remove it? Find an alternative? Make it faster? I don't know.
    - [x] The NBR tool needs to create a certain directory if it doesn't exist, so I don't have to do it on my own.
    - [x] Resources like `ShaderContext`, `Skybox`, and others that take in other resources as arguments, should be given a path as well.
    - [x] Make resources be less dependent on `ResourceID`. The ID should be given when the resources are pushed, but not to be used _in place_ of resources.
    - [x] Fix the way the `Transform` type is edited through the GUI
    - [x] Add OGG support in the NBR tool

- [] GFX v1.1 
    - [x] Add instancing
    - [x] Test instancing
    - [x] Improve shader workflow (using `glGetProgramiv` to get various information about the shader)
    - [x] Improve framebuffers
    - [x] State-specific configuration
    - [] Compute shader support, with dispatching.
    - [] Documentation
- [] Renderer v0.6 
    - [x] Re-introduce the command system into the renderer. Have a `RenderCommand` structure that can be queued by the renderer. 
    - [x] Improve the render pass system to be more versitile. It's very "stiff" right now.
    - [x] Improve the current render passes and test with client-side render passes.
    - [] Introduce a `RenderComputeCommand`. It will make the renderer "dispatch" the command to the compute shader instead of rendering it, using the work groups as it's input. 
    - [] Look into making the renderer "instanced" rather than rendering everything as is.
    - [] Improve the Blinn-Phong lighting model by actually using specular maps and maybe fixing the material system a bit. 
    - [] Improve lighting using clustered rendering. Or, if it's too difficult, you can limit the amount of point lights a scene can have.
    - [] Cascaded shadow maps
    - [] Bloom integration 
    - [] Normal/roughness mapping.
    - [] Documentation
- [] Resource Manager v0.5
    - [x] Instead of using an abstracted `NBR` layer over everything, write extra `file_write_bytes` functions for the various resources, which will write a _compressed_ version of the resources, and load them as well.
    - [] Improve the NBR tool to have a "packging" option that compiles all of the resources into one "blob" called `nkpkg`.
    - [] Implement a way to load `nkpkg` files with a function called `resources_push_package`.
    - [] Fix 3D models loading. 
        - [] Add a parent and child relationship between meshes. Basically, every mesh should have a `local_position` which is set to `Vec3(0.0f)` by default, and it will be take into account when rendering.
        - [] I think the renderer assumes the vertex data of the mesh so if a model has even an extra vertex data like color, the renderer messes everything up. Or limit all 3D models to a certain vertx data set. 
        - [] Make sure that materials are loaded correctly using Assimp (colors and other uniforms).
    - [x] Let the material be created using a `MaterialDesc` structure for more effecient material usage. 
    - [] Documentation
- [] Performance Craze 0.1 
    - [x] Implement both performance timers and normal timers
    - [x] Run some tests through an instrumentation tool of some kind to know _truly_ what is slowing down the application.
    - [] Create an abstraction layer over threads, mutexes, aotmics, and all things multi-threading. 
    - [] Create a simple job system 
    - [] Improve resource loading time by adding asynchronous resource loading.
    - [] Also look into custom memory pools/memory arenas since they can increase performance.
    - [] Documentation
- [] Particles v0.1 
    - [] Add CPU-based particles that can render different shapes, sizes, and colors (maybe even certain textures?) 
    - [] Implement a GPU-based particle system, using something like instancing.

## Showcases

- Showing the gradual change with each render pass in a simple scene.
- Particles showcase, using instancing. 
- Compute shaders with the planet blowing up?

## BUGS:
- (Dist): Improve the `NikolaProjectTemplate` by adding a template shader.
- (Physics): Deleting bodies has some problems since the world delets bodies by keeping a "world index" inside the internal body data structure, which then it uses to 
get the correct position (as an iterator) in the vector to then delete. However, that index is sometimes _way_ higher than the actual size of the array of bodies. Is keeping a collection for bodies in the physics world 
with a physics library really that necessary?
- (Physics): Listen, just remove the physics library. It's really not all that useful. It bring more pain and suffering than joy. I can do a better one with my hands tied behind my back whilst singing Katyusha. 

- Check all of the `TODO`, `FIX`, and `TEMP` in the codebase.

## FUTURE PLANS: 
- NUSL: Nikola Uniform Shading Language or shader-generating materials
