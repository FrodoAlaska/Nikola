# TODO:

- [] Improve UI 
    - [x] Make the system interface
    - [x] Make the render interface
    - [] RmlUi abstractions
        - [] Context 
        - [] Input
        - [] Element 
        - [] Text 
        - [] Button 
        - [] Slider 
        - [] Etc...
    - [] Extended features
        - [] Transforms 
        - [] Animations 
        - [] Trying different shaders 
        - [] Clip mask 
        - [] Etc...
    - [] Documentation
- [] Animations 
    - [] OZZ animation? I mean, it's, like, fucking _amazing_. More research needed.
    - [] Test animations with multiple instances.
    - [] Documentation
- [] GPU Particles
    - [] GPU-based particle system, using compute shaders.
    - [] Have a lot of options to edit the shape, distribution, and gravity. Perhaps save it in a file?
    - [] Documentation
- [] Resources 
    - [] Material file format like `.mat` or something?
    - [] Maybe have a JSON file that associates the resources with each other? 
        - Perhaps we can use this as a way to represent our materials and then save them a `.nbr` files.
        - For example, a texture can be referred in a material and a material can be referred to in a mesh. 
        - That way, we can have the artists (and even myself) use different combinations of resources as we liked.
        - It's almost like a description of how the resources will be used. 
        - We can also take it a step further and make it edit lights and their parameters.
    - [] Documentation
- [] Scenes?
- [] Performance v2.0
    - [] You _have_ to find a way to improve the run time of the physics 
        - [] Put the `physics_world_step` function on a separate thread, almost like running a server
        - [] The `event_dispatch` function should be thread-safe. However, I'm not sure. It does only iterate through the events and calls functions. Test it, nonetheless.
    - [] Improve the load times of the resource manager
    - [] NBR conversion time enhancement
- [] Renderer: Beautify v2.0 
    - This one is just a thinking exersice. We don't want to add every rendering technique under the sun to "beautify" the engine's look. 
    - [] Gaussian blur
    - [] Bloom integration 
    - [] Diffuse irradiance IBL (at least)
    - [] Global illumination (GI) 
- [] Renderer: Extra primitives 
    - [] More shapes like planes, capsules, and so on.
    - [] Decal rendering 
    - [] Add noise functions to the math library
    - [] Terrain rendering and procedural generation (terrain generation using `stb_perlin` and loading from heightmap)
    - [] Documentation

## BUGS:

- (Renderer): Capsules cannot be rendererd. Need to render those for debug purposes. 
- (Renderer): Spheres are not so perfect. Fix that. 

- Check all of the `TODO`, `FIX`, and `TEMP` in the codebase.
